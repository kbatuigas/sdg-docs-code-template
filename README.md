# Crash Course: Docs-as-Code

This repo contains an HTML5 template called [Stellar](https://html5up.net/stellar), built by [ajlkn](https://github.com/ajlkn/responsive-tools). We'll use this template as a stand-in for our project source code while learning a docs-as-code workflow.  

## Docs-as-code setup

- git
- A github.com account
- A text editor
- Command line terminal
- Hugo

We'll use Markdown to write documentation content. We'll also use the [gh-pages branch system](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#deployment-of-project-pages-from-your-gh-pages-branch) to deploy the docs site to GitHub Project Pages.

## How to use this repository

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the fork locally on your machine
3. Build out the Hugo site/project within the repository
4. Commit changes to source code and push as desired
5. When ready to publish documentation, carry out a Hugo site build and push built pages up to fork on the gh-pages branch

A step-by-step guide is provided in the [crash-course.md](./crash-course.md) file.
